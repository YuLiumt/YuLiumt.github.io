We investigate the probable association between G4.8+6.2 and the guest star of AD 1163.

![guest star](AD1163.pdf)

AD 1163 was initially regarded as a nova. Stephenson (1971)
argued that the guest star of AD 1163 may have been a previous outburst of the Type Ia SN Kepler of AD 1604. Yau (1988) argued that AD 1163 could have been a periodic outburst with a period of approximately 800 yr, while no other observations being reported. We suggest that G4.8+6.2 is a KNR associated with the guest star AD 1163.

Note: The guest star of AD 1163 was recorded in the Korean historical book, while it was not shown in the Chinese historical book. However, ‘Songshi Tianwenzhi’, which is an officially edited history book for Song Dynasty, has a record about the Moon invading Saturn around the same time.
